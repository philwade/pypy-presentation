PyPy

Phil Wade

--

Programming Languages - what are they?

A specification
An interpeter
A compiler

Just programs that interpet code.
Written like any other program - in code.

--

There is a pattern in here...

Python - C
Ruby - C
Java - C++

--
Python actually has quite a few different interpeters.

CPython - what most people mean when they say "Python"
IronPython - for the mono/.NET platform
Jython - written in Java, runs on JVM
Unladen Swallow - Optimized CPython, written by Google, discontinued
Psyco - an JIT for Python, written in C, discontinued
PyPy - Python in Python
--
C is hard, let's go shopping

PyPy is an implementation of Python in Python
An academic project, inspired by Psyco
The project has two pieces - RPython Toolchain and PyPy
PyPy is the interpetor written in RPython, compiled by the RPython toolchain

--

RPython

Is a subset of Python
{code}
well suited to static analysis

Rules
variables can only contain a single type
module level globals are considered constants
run time class creation not allowed
for loops only for built in structures

--
RPython Toolchain

Goes through a series of steps
Translates the code into an efficient version for the target platform
- currently support C, .NET, JVM targets
Generates a JIT from the interpetor implementation, automagically

--

More about how the toolchain builds the stuff it does

analysis -> generation -> compilation -> etc
--

That's nice, but who cares?

SPEED
...some times

some benchmarks

--
Fast

 pwade pwade-mac Euler $ time python euler10.py
 142913828922

 real    0m28.222s
 user    0m28.203s
 sys     0m0.017s
 pwade pwade-mac Euler $ time pypy euler10.py
 142913828922

 real    0m2.776s
 user    0m2.758s
 sys     0m0.016s

get the best performance differences from cpu bound stuff as opposed to file/io stuff
--
Slow

Tests, short things - JIT needs time to warm up
Things that CPython implements in pure C
They are re-done in Python typically and the JIT can't always match

Slow example
--
What can't it currently do?

Python 3
NumPy
--
Who uses it?
--
Other neat things
Also, did I mention it generates a JIT *for you*
Topaz
a ruby implementation on top of RPython
The Php RPython implementation
